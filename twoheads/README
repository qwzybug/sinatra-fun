Simplest example I could think of to serve two Sinatra apps that can speak to
one another.

To make it work:
symlink left/public and right/public to multi/left and multi/right,
and do something like this in your apache .conf file:

<VirtualHost *>
   DocumentRoot /path/to/your/multi
   RailsEnv development
   RackBaseURI /left
   RackBaseURI /right
</VirtualHost>

Things I don't like:

- Routes are defined app-relative, but links are server-relative.
So, the main method for the left head is '/', but you link to it with '/left/'.

- It's only 6 LoC, there's only so much I can hate for now.
